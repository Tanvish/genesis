	<p class="article"><font face = "Indie Flower">
	Death note is actually an awesome killer-detective anime.Light Yagami a college student
who possesses the death note and kill people.That's when "L" comes in, the lead detective 
of the investigation of "kira" or the "killer". Light always seems to be one step ahead of the investigation
team as he was very clever plus had an advantage that his dad was also in the investigation
team L and light both are very smart and sharp and constantly outwit each other.They both try to kill each
other all Light needed was a name and a face to kill L but L needed to find Kira or Light in the whole world.
This is a must watch anime its at its best it.You cannot actually predict whats gonna happen next not even a
single step whats gonna happen next. You just have to watch the first two episodes patiently after that
it completely blows off your mind trust me you just cant stop yourself your curiosity gets over you.If you haven't watched it till
now you must watch it otherwise your life is incomplete lol thats what I say to my friends who havent watched it
till now.I recommend to all of you who are seeing this blog.
